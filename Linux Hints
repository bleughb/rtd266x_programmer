Newbie to Linux here, had some issues getting this going on my laptop....Some Hints if you're using a Live CD

Firstly, live CD's don't come with everything needed, 
you may need to add the depositories to your live CD if it can't find i2c-tools

Make not working
you may need to install Make for G++

sudo apt-get install build-essential g++


Final Running, you'll need to run the command Sudo ./rtd_prog -d 1 -b backup.bin
